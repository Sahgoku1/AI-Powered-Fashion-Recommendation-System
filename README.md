# FINAL 
This project implements an end-to-end AI-powered framework for analyzing fashion styles and providing recommendations. It transforms unstructured fashion data from luxury and retail brands into structured insights using web scraping, large language models (LLMs), and machine learning techniques.

Features
- Web scraping of fashion product data from luxury and retail brands
- Data structuring using LLMs to generate detailed product descriptions
- PostgreSQL database for structured data storage
- ChromaDB for vector embedding storage
- Recommendation system with three use cases:
  1. Luxury to retail item recommendations
  2. Text-to-product recommendations
  3. Image-to-product recommendations
- Semantic similarity analysis using cosine similarity and hierarchical clustering
- Brand classification using RandomForestClassifier

Technologies Used
- Python
- PostgreSQL
- Docker
- ChromaDB
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Embedding Models
- Scikit-learn
